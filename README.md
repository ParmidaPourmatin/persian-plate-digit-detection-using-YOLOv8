# persian-plate-digit-detection-using-YOLOv8

This Project has been implemented using YOLOv8. In the first step, we have trained the model on the dataset of persian plate digits. Then, we have used the trained model to detect the digits in the images. In the last step, we have used the detected digits to predict the plate number.
